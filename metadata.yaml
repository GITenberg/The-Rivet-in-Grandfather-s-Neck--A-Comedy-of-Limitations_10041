description: This 1915 novel is set in Virginia in the waning years of the nineteenth
  century. A marriage between an aristocratic Southern gentleman and the spoiled daughter
  of a businessman affords Cabell the opportunity, with lapidary grace and gently
  devastating irony, of skewering the chivalric illusions of the Old South.
